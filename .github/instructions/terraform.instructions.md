## Tooling and orchestration

- Use **Terraform** (not Bicep or ARM) for all Azure infrastructure.
- Use **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** to orchestrate provisioning (`azd provision`) and deployment (`azd deploy`).
- Store remote state in **Azure Blob Storage** via an `azurerm` backend. Backend configuration is supplied through `infra/provider.conf.json` with `${RS_*}` and `${AZURE_ENV_NAME}` placeholders that azd substitutes at runtime.
- Variable values are supplied through `infra/main.tfvars.json` with `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders that azd substitutes from its environment. This is the primary mechanism for passing configuration from azd to Terraform.
- Before provisioning, the operator sets remote state coordinates: `azd env set RS_RESOURCE_GROUP <rg>`, `azd env set RS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT <sa>`, `azd env set RS_CONTAINER_NAME <container>`.
- Always look up the latest stable versions of Terraform providers during development before pinning.

## Formatting and validation

- Format every Terraform change during development with `terraform -chdir=infra fmt -recursive`.
- Before considering a Terraform change complete, run `terraform -chdir=infra fmt -check -recursive` and `terraform -chdir=infra validate`.
- Run `terraform -chdir=infra init -backend=false` before validation when the working directory has not been initialized or provider/module requirements have changed.
- Treat Terraform warnings as failures. A Terraform change is complete only when formatting checks and validation finish with zero errors and zero warnings.
- Resolve all formatting and validation findings caused by the change; do not suppress, ignore, or defer them.

## Azure Developer CLI (azd) variable flow

- azd owns the lifecycle of environment variables. Terraform receives them via `main.tfvars.json` placeholder substitution.
- Core Azure context variables are supplied by azd automatically or set by the operator:
  - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_LOCATION` — set during `azd init` or `azd env set`.
  - `AZURE_ENV_NAME` — the azd environment name (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
  - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` — the target resource group.
  - `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` — the deployer's Entra object ID (used for RBAC bootstrapping).
- Additional variables (networking, service-specific config) are set via `azd env set` and referenced in `main.tfvars.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "azure": {
      "subscription_id": "${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}",
      "tenant_id": "${AZURE_TENANT_ID}",
      "location": "${AZURE_LOCATION}",
      "environment_name": "${AZURE_ENV_NAME}",
      "resource_group_name": "${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}",
      "principal_id": "${AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID}"
    }
  }
  ```
- Terraform root-module outputs are automatically captured by azd and made available as environment variables for subsequent `azd deploy` steps and service configuration.
- Assume every useful child-module output will be mapped by the root module to the canonical environment-variable name expected by azd. When azd defines or conventionally expects a name for a value, always use that exact name instead of inventing a project-specific alternative. For example, expose an Azure Container Registry name as `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` and its login server as `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`.
- When adding infrastructure that produces values needed by the application or by azd service mappings, add corresponding root-module outputs with canonical azd-compatible SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE names.

## Provider configuration

- Require `terraform >= 1.9`.
- Pin providers with pessimistic constraints (`~>`) in both root and child modules.
- Commonly used providers: `azurerm`, `azurecaf`, `azuread`, `azapi`, `random`, `time`.
- Use `azapi` when a resource or property is not yet supported by `azurerm`.
- Configure `azurerm` with `storage_use_azuread = true` for Entra-based storage auth.
- Set `features` block: `purge_soft_delete_on_destroy = false`, `recover_soft_deleted_key_vaults = true`, `prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = true`.
- Declare `backend "azurerm" {}` with no inline config; all values come from `provider.conf.json`.

## Resource group convention

- **Never create the resource group in Terraform.** Assume the resource group is pre-created and passed in via `var.azure.resource_group_name`.
- Reference the resource group with a data source:
  ```hcl
  data "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
    name = var.azure.resource_group_name
  }
  ```
- Use `data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` and `data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.location` throughout.

## Azure resource implementation

- **Do not use Azure Verified Modules** (`Azure/avm-res-*`).
- Define Azure resources directly with `azurerm_*` resources whenever the AzureRM provider supports the required resource and properties.
- Use `azapi_*` resources only when the required resource or property is unavailable in `azurerm`.
- Prefer dedicated resources for role assignments, diagnostic settings, and private endpoints so their lifecycle and dependencies remain explicit.
- Pin `azurerm` and `azapi` provider versions with `~>` constraints. Look up the latest stable versions on the Terraform registry before using.

## Variable design

- Group related configuration into **typed objects** rather than using many flat variables. Deployment-specific settings must be required object attributes without Terraform defaults. Examples:
  ```hcl
  variable "azure" {
    type = object({
      subscription_id     = string
      tenant_id           = string
      location            = string
      environment_name    = string
      resource_group_name = string
      principal_id        = string
    })
  }

  variable "sql" {
    type = object({
      sku_name    = string
      max_size_gb = number
    })
  }
  ```
- Specify all deployment sizing and runtime configuration explicitly in `main.tfvars.json`. This includes SKUs, tiers, VM sizes, CPU, memory, capacity, replica counts, storage sizes, throughput, retention periods, port numbers, timeouts, and similar service-specific settings.
- Do not default deployment-specific settings in `variable` blocks, `optional()` type attributes, locals, resources, or modules. Root variables and child-module inputs for these settings must be required, and the root module must pass them explicitly.
- Keep environment-specific values as azd `${PLACEHOLDER}` entries in `main.tfvars.json`; keep fixed project choices as explicit literal values in that file. The tfvars file must remain the visible source of every deployed specification.
- Add `validation` blocks for variables that have constrained value sets or formats.
- Use a `tags` variable (`map(string)`, default `{}`) for user-provided tag overrides.
- Use a `naming` object variable with a short `project_name` (1–8 lowercase alphanumeric) for resource naming.
- Require a `public_network_access_enabled` boolean at the root, set it explicitly in `main.tfvars.json`, and propagate it to every module. This enables deliberate toggling between public-accessible and private-only deployments.
- When a new deployment-specific variable is needed, add it to `variables.tf` without a default and to `main.tfvars.json` with an azd `${PLACEHOLDER}` if operator-supplied or an explicit literal value if fixed per project.

## Naming conventions

- Use the `azurecaf` provider (`azurecaf_name` resources) to generate Azure-compliant resource names.
- Derive a deterministic **resource token** from location, subscription, and resource group:
  ```hcl
  locals {
    resource_token_sha = base64encode(sha256("${var.azure.location}${data.azurerm_client_config.current.subscription_id}${var.azure.resource_group_name}"))
    resource_token     = substr(join("", regexall("[a-z0-9]", lower(local.resource_token_sha))), 0, 13)
  }
  ```
- Pass `resource_token` to all child modules and use it as the `name` argument in `azurecaf_name`.
- Always set `random_length = 0` and `clean_input = true` for deterministic, idempotent naming.
- Use `suffixes` to distinguish resources (e.g., `["identity"]`, `["law"]`, `["stor"]`, `["plan"]`).

## Tagging

- Build `default_tags` in a `locals` block by merging a base set with user-provided `var.tags`:
  ```hcl
  locals {
    default_tags = merge(
      {
        project     = "<repo-name>"
        environment = var.azure.environment_name
        managed_by  = "terraform"
      },
      var.tags
    )
  }
  ```
- Pass `local.default_tags` (or `tags = var.tags` inside modules) to every resource and module.
- For azd-deployed services, add `azd-env-name` and `azd-service-name` tags.

## Module structure

- Organize infrastructure into **child modules** under `infra/modules/<service>/`.
- Every module contains exactly four files:
  - `providers.tf` — required providers (version-pinned, matching root constraints).
  - `variables.tf` — input variables with types, descriptions, defaults, and validations.
  - `main.tf` — resource definitions.
  - `outputs.tf` — exported values for the root to consume.
- Common module input variables: `resource_token`, `resource_group_name`, `location`, `tags`, `public_network_access_enabled`.
- Use `count` on modules to make entire service blocks optional (e.g., `count = var.app_service.enabled ? 1 : 0`).
- Use `for_each` for sets of similar resources (e.g., multiple web apps).

## Networking and private endpoints

- Assume the target virtual network and subnets already exist. Reference them with `data "azurerm_virtual_network"` and `data "azurerm_subnet"` data sources, or accept existing subnet IDs as inputs; do not create VNets or subnets in this Terraform configuration.
- Pass an existing `private_endpoint_subnet_id` into modules that need private endpoints.
- Assume the required private DNS zones already exist and are associated with Azure Deploy If Not Exists (DINE) policies that configure private endpoint DNS zone groups and virtual network links.
- Create only the private endpoints with `azurerm_private_endpoint` resources, or `azapi_resource` only when AzureRM lacks required functionality. Do not create or manage private DNS zones, private DNS virtual network links, or private DNS zone groups in Terraform.
- Every `azurerm_private_endpoint` resource, regardless of service or module, must ignore changes to its policy-managed DNS zone group:
  ```hcl
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [private_dns_zone_group]
  }
  ```
  This is required even when the resource does not declare a `private_dns_zone_group` block, because DINE policies add the block after endpoint creation and Terraform must not remove it or report drift.
- Name private endpoints as `{resource_name}-pe` and service connections as `{resource_name}-psc`.
- Default to private-only access (`public_network_access_enabled = false`). The root variable allows toggling for development.

## RBAC and identity

- Always favor **user-assigned managed identities** and Azure RBAC for authentication and authorization between Azure services.
- Create a user-assigned managed identity for each application or workload identity boundary, and pass its resource ID, principal ID, and client ID to every module that requires service-to-service access.
- Prefer user-assigned identities over system-assigned identities so identity lifecycle, role assignments, and reuse remain explicit and independent of a single resource.
- Use identity-based SDK authentication and service endpoints at runtime. Do not use access keys, shared secrets, embedded credentials, or connection strings containing credentials when managed identity and Azure RBAC are supported.
- Use credential-based authentication only when the target service does not support managed identity or Azure RBAC; document the limitation and store required secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Create role assignments with `azurerm_role_assignment` resources, using `azapi_resource` only when AzureRM cannot express the required assignment.
- Apply least-privilege roles (e.g., `Storage Blob Data Contributor` not `Owner`).
- For role assignments on resources with eventual-consistency identity propagation, use `time_sleep` resources as explicit dependencies.
- Use `uuidv5("dns", ...)` for deterministic role assignment `name` fields to ensure idempotency.
- Grant the deployer principal (`var.azure.principal_id`) admin-level access for initial setup (e.g., `Key Vault Secrets Officer`).
- Grant the app identity only data-level access (e.g., `Key Vault Secrets User`, `Storage Blob Data Contributor`).

## Outputs

- Export values that downstream azd deployment or application configuration needs (connection strings, URIs, resource names).
- Mark sensitive outputs with `sensitive = true` (connection strings, instrumentation keys, FQDNs).
- Design child-module outputs with the assumption that the root module will map them to azd environment variables. Child-module output names may describe the value idiomatically, but their corresponding root-module outputs must use the expected azd names.
- Before naming a root-module output, determine whether azd has a standard or expected environment-variable name for that resource or value. If one exists, always use it exactly; only introduce a new SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE name when azd has no applicable convention.
- Prefer azd-compatible names such as `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` and `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` over custom alternatives such as `ACR_NAME`, `REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER`, or service-prefixed variants.
- Use ternary expressions for outputs from conditional modules: `var.x.enabled ? module.x[0].output : null`.
- Terraform outputs are automatically captured by azd after `azd provision` and become available as environment variables for `azd deploy` and application runtime.

## Monitoring and diagnostics

- Always deploy a **Log Analytics Workspace** and **Application Insights** resource (monitoring module).
- Pass the Log Analytics workspace ID to all modules so they can configure `diagnostic_settings`.
- Configure diagnostics with `azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting` resources and appropriate enabled log categories and metrics.

## General best practices

- Use `data` sources to reference pre-existing resources (VNets, subnets, resource groups) — never recreate shared infrastructure.
- Prefer explicit `depends_on` over implicit dependency when ordering matters for identity propagation or RBAC.
- Keep modules focused on a single Azure service or logical grouping.
- Add descriptions to all variables, outputs, and complex locals.
- Use `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [...] }` sparingly and only for properties managed outside Terraform, including private endpoint DNS zone groups managed by Azure DINE policies.
